## Using Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection in FFNN and Casper NN

Assignment Author: Xiangyi Luo

The model reproduces network invented in [the Casper paper](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-CasPer-architecture-a-second-hidden-neuron-has-just-been-added-The-vertical-lines_fig1_220934751).

The model is used for analyzing observers' phsiological signals (the obsersers reaction to depression video).


To run models, use model_comparison.py.  
Just uncomment model block you want to use, it will do evaluation and visualisation automatically.
