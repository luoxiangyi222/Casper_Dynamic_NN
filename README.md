## Using Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection in FFNN and Casper NN

Author: Xiangyi Luo

The model reproduces network in [the Casper paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227146979_A_Cascade_network_algorithm_employing_Progressive_RPROP).

The model is used for analyzing observers' physiological signals (the obsersers reaction to depression video).


To run models, use model_comparison.py.  
Please uncomment model block you want to use, it will do evaluation and visualisation automatically.
